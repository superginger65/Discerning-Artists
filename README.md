# Discerning Artists

This project is intended to be used to tell the difference between two artists using Machine Learning.

## Description

This is a project I created in my Machine Learning class. I was able to use this algorithm to,
with around 80-90% accuracy, determine whether a song was written by Machine Gun Kelly or Eminem.

## Getting Started

* Main IDE: Jupyter Notebook using Python 3

### Programs Used

* Spotify
* Sidify

### Dependencies

* numpy 
* pandas 
* scipy
* sklearn
